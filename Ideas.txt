--Ideas for Site--

- About Page+
(About page talking about stuff I do, maybe more pages on specific stuff (e.g old workshop stuff)

- The Rabbithole
(Several pages of meaningless nonsense relating to things such as the government, school, reality, etc. Will either turn out super sick or very, very cringe. Also include fucked up graphics in the pages (distorted text & overlapping text, very bright colours & broken images (you know what I mean)) cuz that'll add to the weirdness of the pages.)

- Main Site Background
(Transparent repeating texture (maybe a cool simple animated pixel gif by me, or a random texture if I'm feeling lazy.) which inverts inside the links area.)
